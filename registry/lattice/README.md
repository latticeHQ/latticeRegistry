# Lattice

Official modules maintained by the Lattice team for extending [Lattice — Agent Headquarters](https://latticeruntime.com) deployments.

## Module Categories

- **Identity**: Authentication and authorization for AI agents (OAuth, OIDC, API keys)
- **Policy**: Runtime enforcement rules and deployment constraints
- **Integration**: Connections to AI services (LiveKit, Deepgram, ElevenLabs, Cartesia)
- **Monitoring**: Audit logging, tracing, and observability
- **Templates**: Complete agent deployment configurations (Docker, K8s, AWS, GCP, Azure)
- **Presets**: Compliance-focused setups (HIPAA, SOC2, healthcare scenarios)

## Part of the Lattice Ecosystem

These modules extend [Lattice Runtime](https://github.com/latticeHQ/lattice) — the enforcement kernel — with reusable infrastructure for agent deployments. See the [Registry README](../../README.md) for contributing guidelines.
